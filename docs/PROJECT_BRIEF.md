# KEENERJA: Enhanced Approval Workflow System

KEENERJA is designed to streamline and simplify the approval workflow processes within organizations, making it easier for teams to manage, execute, and track workflows efficiently. The system focuses on user-centric management, customizable workflows, and flexible approval mechanisms to adapt to various business needs.

## Key Features

### User Management System

This core feature allows administrators to oversee and control user access across the organization. Key functionalities include:

- **User Registration and Onboarding**: Users can sign up and be assigned to one or more organizations. Each user is linked to specific roles that define their permissions and responsibilities.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures that users only access workflows and data relevant to their roles, enhancing security and compliance.
- **Organization Management**: Owners can create and manage multiple organizations, inviting users and assigning roles within each.
- **User Profiles**: Maintain detailed profiles including contact information, role assignments, and activity logs for auditing purposes.

### Workflow System

The workflow system empowers organizations to design and deploy processes that align with their operational needs. Highlights include:

- **Workflow Creation and Customization**: Users with appropriate roles (e.g., Operators) can build workflows from scratch or use templates. Workflows can include steps like form submissions, approvals, notifications, and integrations with external tools.
- **Form Builder**: Integrated form creation tools allow for dynamic forms with various field types (text, dropdowns, file uploads) to capture necessary data at each workflow stage.
- **Automation and Triggers**: Automate workflow initiation based on events, such as time-based triggers or data inputs, reducing manual intervention.
- **Workflow Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards to track progress, bottlenecks, and completion rates, with options for reporting and analytics.

### Approval System

The approval system provides robust, condition-based decision-making for workflows. Key aspects:

- **Custom Approval Rules**: Define approval hierarchies and conditions, such as requiring multiple approvers, conditional approvals based on data values (e.g., budget thresholds), or escalation paths if deadlines are missed.
- **Multi-Level Approvals**: Support for sequential or parallel approvals, ensuring that workflows can handle complex decision trees.
- **Notifications and Reminders**: Automated alerts to approvers via email, in-app notifications, or integrations with communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams.
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all approval actions, including timestamps, user details, and reasons for decisions, to maintain transparency and compliance.

## Detailed User Brief

### User Structure

In KEENERJA, a **User** represents an individual interacting with the system. Each user can belong to multiple organizations, allowing flexibility for users working across departments or companies. Within each organization, a user holds exactly one role, preventing conflicts and ensuring clear responsibilities.

### User Roles and Permissions

Users are categorized into three primary roles, each with distinct capabilities:

1. **Owner**

   - **Primary Function**: The foundational user who initiates the organization's presence in KEENERJA.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Registers the organization and becomes its default administrator.
     - Can create additional organizations under their account.
     - Invites and adds other users to organizations, assigning roles as needed.
     - Has full administrative access, including the ability to modify organization settings, manage billing, and oversee high-level configurations.
   - **Limitations**: Owners cannot directly manage day-to-day workflow operations unless they also hold an Operator role in a specific organization.

2. **Operator**

   - **Primary Function**: Handles the operational aspects of workflows and organizational management.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Designs, edits, and deploys workflows and forms.
     - Manages organization-specific settings, such as user permissions within the org.
     - Monitors workflow executions, generates reports, and troubleshoots issues.
     - Can integrate workflows with third-party services (e.g., APIs for data syncing).
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for IT administrators, project managers, or process owners who need to maintain and optimize the system's functionality.

3. **Member**
   - **Primary Function**: The end-user who actively participates in workflows by providing inputs and advancing processes.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Accesses assigned workflows and submits forms as required.
     - Receives notifications for tasks, approvals, or updates.
     - Views their workflow history and status.
   - **Use Case**: Typically employees or stakeholders who are the primary actors in day-to-day operations, such as submitting expense reports or requesting approvals.

This structure ensures a balanced distribution of responsibilities, promoting efficiency and security within the approval workflow ecosystem. KEENERJA aims to reduce friction in organizational processes, enabling faster decision-making and better collaboration.
